> We actively adjust your portfolio to account for changing market conditions. As certain market segments become more attractive, we shift your portfolio to own more 
> of those areas and less of the unattractively valued areas. Our goal is to increase your return over time using a tried-and-true investment approach – all in the    > context of your specific circumstances and your plan.
