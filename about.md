### Innovation - “The most damaging phrase in the language is: ‘it’s always been done that way.’” - Grace Hopper

### Humility - Some of our founder’s parting words were to ‘be willing to admit when we were wrong.’ We carry on that tradition in all we do.

### Objectivity - We routinely evaluate our decision-making and show a willingness to change our minds given new evidence.

# Pick good technology to improve our research at lower cost and know how to use the features available to data-rich firms as skilled operators.
