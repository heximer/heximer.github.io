## Disclosures

Heximer Investment Management, Inc. (RIA) is a Registered Investment Adviser with the Ohio Division of Securities. Registration does not imply a certain level of skill or training. RIA and its representatives are in compliance with the current filing requirements imposed upon registered investment advisers by those states in which RIA maintains clients. RIA may only transact business in those states in which it is registered, or qualifies for an exemption or exclusion from registration requirements. RIA’s web site is limited to the dissemination of general information pertaining to its advisory services, together with access to additional investment-related information, publications, and links. Accordingly, the publication of RIA’s web site on the Internet should not be construed by any consumer and/or prospective client as RIA’s solicitation to effect, or attempt to effect transactions in securities, or the rendering of personalized investment advice for compensation, over the Internet. For information pertaining to the registration status of RIA, please contact the SEC or the state securities regulators for those states in which RIA maintains a filing. A copy of RIA’s current written disclosure statement as set forth on Part II of form ADV is available upon request. RIA does not make any representations or warranties as to the accuracy, timeliness, suitability, completeness, or relevance of any information prepared by any unaffiliated third party, whether linked to RIA’s web site or incorporated herein, and takes no responsibility therefore. All such information is provided solely for convenience purposes and all users thereof should be guided accordingly.  

Past performance may not be indicative of future results. Therefore, no current or prospective client should assume that future performance of any specific investment or investment strategy (including the investments and/or investment strategies recommended or undertaken by RIA) made reference to directly or indirectly by RIA in its web site, or indirectly via a link to an unaffiliated third party web site, will be profitable or equal the corresponding indicated performance level(s). Different types of investments involve varying degrees of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific investment will either be suitable or profitable for a client or prospective client’s investment portfolio nor that the future performance of any specific investment or investment strategy (including those undertaken or recommended by RIA), will be profitable or equal any historical performance level(s).  

Certain portions of RIA’s web site (i.e. newsletters, articles, commentaries, etc.) may contain a discussion of, and/or provide access to, RIA’s (and those of other investment and non-investment professionals) positions and/or recommendations as of a specific prior date. Due to various factors, including changing market conditions, such discussion may no longer be reflective of current position(s) and/or recommendation(s). Moreover, no client or prospective client should assume that any such discussion serves as the receipt of, or a substitute for, personalized advice from RIA, or from any other investment professional. RIA is neither an attorney nor an accountant, and no portion of the web site content should be interpreted as legal, accounting or tax advice.  

To the extent that any client or prospective client utilizes any economic calculator or similar device contained within or linked to RIA’s web site, the client and/or prospective client acknowledges and understands that the information resulting from the use of any such calculator/device, is not, and should not be construed, in any manner whatsoever, as the receipt of, or a substitute for, personalized individual advice from RIA, or from any other investment professional.  

Each client and prospective client agrees, as a condition precedent to his/her/its access to RIA’s web site, to release and hold harmless RIA, its officers, directors, owners, employees and agents from any and all adverse consequences resulting from any of his/her/its actions and/or omissions which are independent of his/her/its receipt of personalized individual advice from RIA.
