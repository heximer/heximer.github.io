Our featured [article](https://github.com/heximer/him2/raw/master/assets/An Update on Today's Bond Market.pdf) this quarter talks about what we are seeing in the bond market today. 

This [Personal Document Locator](https://github.com/heximer/him2/raw/master/assets/personal document locator.pdf) is simply a detailed list of where you store your important records and papers 
and who your primary advisors and contacts are. This list will assist your loved ones in the event of your death 
or disability. Keep this list at home along with your other important documents, and make sure a trusted family 
member knows where it is, or provide a copy to the family member, your executor, and/or your attorney.
